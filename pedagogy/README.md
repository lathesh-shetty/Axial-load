#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept
<div style="text-align: justify">
<u>About the Experiment:</u><br>
Axial loads experiment is carried out to calculate stress, strain and deflection of a work piece When a load parallel to the axis of rotation of the body is acting on it. The purpose of this experiment is to determine how cross-sectional area, material and applied load effects stress and strain, and to better understand the relationship between stress and strain under the elastic limit.
