## Storyboard (Round 2)

<center>Experiment: Disc Type Flywheel</center>

**1. Story Outline**:
<div style="text-align: justify">

Load is defined as any external force acting on machine part, there many types of load one of them being axial load. The forces acting along the axis is known as axial load

When a body is acted upon by external force/load, internal resisting force is set up, such a body is said to be in a state of stress, hence stress is the resistance is the resistance offered by the body to deformation. The internal resistance offered against the external load force may be assumed as uniformly distributed over the whole area of cress section. Thus this internal force per unit area at any section of the body is known as stress. It is denoted by σ(sigma).

When a force or load acts on a body it undergoes deformation. This deformation per unit length is know as unit strain or strain. It is denoted by ε(epsilon) or e.

Hooke’s law states that a when a material is loaded within elastic limit, the stress is directly proportional to strain. i.e, the ratio of stress to strain is a constant within elastic limit. This constant is known as Modulus of Elasticity or “Young’s Modulus”. It is denoted by E.

 **2. Story**:

  **2.1 Set the visual stage description**:
  <div style="text-align: justify">

  The experiment consists of an object subjected to axial load condition whose geometry and material can be changed. On the left hand side of simulation window the objects side view, cross-sectional and deflection can be seen. On the right hand side of simulation window the geometry of the object like length and radius can be varied with the help of knobs, the material and type of axial load can be selected using drop down menu

  In, side view we can see circular rod supported by two black bars, the color of the rod changes based on the selected material and also the direction of force acting on the rod also changes with the selected  load.

  In the comment box on left bottom of the simulation window the required data for calculation is displayed. On the right bottom of the simulation window we can see the correct calculated result.
  When calculation button is pressed on right bottom of simulation window, three user input boxes will be displayed to enter the required calculated value based on variables and constant displayed. To reset the simulation window a simulation button is provided on the bottom right side.

**2.6 Conclusion**:


<div style="text-align: justify">
Time required to perform the virtual experiment.
The approximate time required to understand the procedure to perform the experiment would take about 5 min. The time required to enter the input variables and calculate the unbalanced masses is 15 min. Thus, if the calculated answers are correct, the total time required to perform the experiment will be around 20 min.
